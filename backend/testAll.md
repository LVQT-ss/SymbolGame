### ⚠️ Issues Found

1. **Route Configuration Problem**:

   - Comments and Likes routes are mounted on `/api/comments`
   - But accessed via `/api/game/sessions/{id}/comments` and `/api/game/sessions/{id}/like`
   - **Fix:** Update route mounting in index.js or adjust frontend calls

2. **Game Completion Field Validation**:

   - Existing session completion requires different field format than new session
   - Missing field validation is too strict for round data
   - **Fix:** Review validation logic in game completion endpoint

3. **Database Status**:
   - All core database operations working
   - User creation, authentication, and data persistence confirmed
   - Redis leaderboard integration functional

## Performance Notes

- Response times for game completion
- Leaderboard query performance
- Database query optimization
- Redis cache effectiveness

## Security Verification

- JWT token validation
- Authorization checks (Admin vs Customer)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting (if implemented)

## Data Integrity Checks

- User statistics accuracy
- Leaderboard ranking correctness
- Game score calculations
- Level progression logic

## Recommendations

### 🚀 Priority Fixes

1. **Fix Route Configuration**: Update comment and like routes mounting from `/api/comments` to `/api/game`
2. **Game Completion Validation**: Review field validation logic for existing session completion
3. **Error Response Consistency**: Ensure proper HTTP status codes (403 vs 404)

### 🎯 System Health Assessment
